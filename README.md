This is my WWDC18 scholarship submission.

The main project (an iOS framework) was loaded as a git submodule.

Click "TrainK" directory for the main project repo.

Click WWDC2018.xcworkspace (Instead of MetroMapDemo.playground) to view the playground.

Build the scheme "MetroMap" -> "iPhone" before running the playground.
